Hello I’m Richard Joseph.

I’m a Tech Reporter with more than 5 years of experience in the domain. I try to deliver the most updated, relevant, precise and useful information to my viewers instantly as it is available to the public.

I focus on the current scenarios and affairs centered upon the new product launches, latest company announcements, industry events, and technological breakthroughs.

I’m in contact with high-caliber and reputable tech industry analysts, including entrepreneurs, executives, researchers, and experts. I make my content public after they are verified.

It is requested of my viewers that if they find any piece of the information misleading then they are free to contact and we both will make it updated for our respectable audience. Thank You
